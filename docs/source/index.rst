**fklearn** makes it easier to solve real business problems using Machine Learning. It largely relies on functional programming principles to help achieve this goal.

The name is a tribute to the widely known `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/stable/>`_ library.

**fklearn Principles**

#. Models should be production-ready with few extra steps.
#. Validation should reflect real-life situations.
#. Production models should match validated models.
#. Reproducibility should be easily attainable.
#. In-depth analysis and interpretation of model results should be simple to do.
